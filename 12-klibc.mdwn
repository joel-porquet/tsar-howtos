# HOWTO: Run a klibc-based system

## Compilation of a klibc-based initramfs

- Get [klibc](https://github.com/joel-porquet/tsar-klibc) with TSAR support
- Get the [klibc-based
  initramfs](https://github.com/joel-porquet/tsar-initramfs-klibc)
- Modify the Makefile if necessary:
    - `KERNEL_BASE`: root pathname of Linux directory
    - `KLIBC_BASE`: root pathname of klibc directory
    - `CT_PREFIX`: prefix of your cross-toolchain (should be
      `mipsel-unknown-elf-` if you followed the instructions of the first HOWTO)
- Generate the initramfs:

    make && make install

## Recompilation of Linux

We must recompile Linux to take the newly generated `initramfs` (with the
klibc-based system) into account:

	make ARCH=tsar -j4


## Run

A little after seeing that Linux freed unused kernel memory, you can start to
type in commands (there is no prompt to indicate the command line).

Try listing the content of `/bin` to get the available applications.
