# HOWTO: Run a hello world assembly application

## Installation of the Linux headers

	make ARCH=tsar headers_install

## Generation of a initramfs containing the hello world application

- Get the [hello
  world](https://github.com/joel-porquet/tsar-initramfs-hello-world)-based
  initramfs
- Modify the Makefile if necessary:
 - `KERNEL_BASE`: root pathname of Linux directory
 - `CT_PREFIX`: prefix of your cross-toolchain (should be 
   `mipsel-unknown-elf-` if you followed the instructions of the first HOWTO)
- Generate the initramfs:
```
	make && make install
```

## Recompilation of Linux

We must recompile Linux to take the newly generated `initramfs` (with the hello
world application) into account:

	make ARCH=tsar -j4


## Run

Now the simulation should go on past mounting the initial root filesystem and
execute this user application successfully.
